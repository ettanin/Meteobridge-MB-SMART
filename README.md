# Meteobridge-Beta Version MB-UB40-RRW
reworked pop up scripts using new library , offers better use for mobile devices and using charts in landscape mode
*note almanac data is disabled in mobile devices view , these need to be reworked to be able to use smoothly in landscape
mode on mobile devices.

# This is a BETA version 
important to note this is a beta version and will not recieve frequent changes ,some of these scripts may appear
in the master version maintained by @lightmaster in the future.

# Credits must be retained in pop ups
widely noticed credits are blatantly removed in another version ,not sure why this is an issue but it is what is
and I can only kindly ask the please retain credits in pop ups where CSS used, SVG scripts are used or PHP scripts are used. 
feel free to modify and include your own credit alongside to acknowledge your work and input.

sample credit is all that is required  "Original CSS/SVG/PHP scripts by weather34.com Â© 2015-2019"
