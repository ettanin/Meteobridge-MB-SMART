# This repository is a beta project for Meteobridge-Weather34-Template (expected release 2020)

  display:grid;
  
  grid-template-columns: 236px 236px 236px 236px;
  
  grid-gap: 5px;

this provides the platform for increasing modules to display for example have small charts displayed in small modules
on main page , increase the total of moduels to 24 and choosing optional layouts.
